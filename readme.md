# Blockout

An overlay tool for blacking out regions of a screen.

## Use Case

While working with tables of dense data, my eyes sometimes wander which makes reading 
at a glance a challenge. The idea is to provide a black overlay that allows the user 
to click and draw a transparent hole through which interesting data can be viewed.

## Improvements

- [X] Make it easier to draw the initial hole
- [ ] Support multiple holes
